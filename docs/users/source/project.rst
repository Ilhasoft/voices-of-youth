Project
=======

On :ref:`VoY`, projects are the entry point.

When creating a new project, you can see these fields:
 
* name - Project name;
* description - Project description;
* URL path - The path that will be used to access the project in the browser URL. For example:
**www.voicesofyouth.org / project-path** By leaving this field empty the system will generate a sludgy version of the project name;
* language - The main language used in this project. We'll show you how to add new languages.
* window title - The browser window/tab title.
* Tags - Tags that the user can choose when creating a new report on any theme linked to the project.
.. note::
* Only administrators or local administrators can create/edit themes and add mappers to those themes.
* You can create as many themes as you need;
* You can create more than one theme in the same border region as other themes. For example, a study on health risks and another on safety issues.
.. warning::
The border region of each theme must be within the same region configured in its: term: `project`. This border region may be smaller than the project boundary, but it can never be larger or outside the project area.
.. todo::
   Add a section to teach how to add a new language.

Mapper
------
Mappers are the platform’s target users, young people, who can create reports. 

.. Note::
To be able to create and submit reports, mappers must be registered in the VoY system. 

.. Note::
A mapper can only create a report within the boundaries of the theme’s georeferenced region. 

.. Note::
Only global and local admins can create themes.

Mapper
------
Mappers are the platform’s target users - young people - that can create reports.

.. note::
    To be able to create and submit reports, mappers must be registered in the VoY system.

.. note::
    A mapper can only create a report within the boundaries of the theme’s georeferenced region.

.. note::
    Only global-admin or local-admin can create themes.
